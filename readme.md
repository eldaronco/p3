## Description
This project creates a web application called Developer's Best Friend.  The app includes a Lorem Ipsum Generator and a
Random User Generator.  Both generators can be accessed from the application's main page.

## Details for teaching team
Due to time constraints, there are no bells and whistles here except for a little bootstrap and some validation.  Included is a css folder
for the style.css file and the bootstrap.min.css.

## Outside code
I used the two packages suggested in the assignment:  badcow/lorem-ipsum for the Lorem Ipsum Generator and fzaninotto/faker for
the Random User Generator.  Also I used bootstrap.min.css for styling.
